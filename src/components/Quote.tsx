          "The word mindbody has been suggested to convey the real state of
          things. Not even in the West is mind-body thinking completely new. In
          one of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates quotes a Thracian doctor’s
          criticism of his Greek colleagues: “This is the reason why the cure of
          so many diseases is unknown to the physicians of Hellas; they are
          ignorant of the whole. For this is the great error of our day in the
          treatment of the human body, that physicians separate the mind from
          the body.” You cannot split mind from body, said Socrates—nearly two
          and a half millennia before the advent of
          psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology!”
