        I am already due for my next lab work to find out whether my persistent
        sore throat is a sign of relapse or just another inconvenience of life.
        I am slowly realising that{" "}
        <b>living with a chronic illness is a marathon, not a sprint,</b> with a
        large part of it fought in the mind.

        Sometimes I wonder if life would be easier had I opted for a “simpler”
        solution like surgery or RAI. I have now finished one year without
        medication and I keep asking myself: at what point can I truly say this
        is behind me? I guess only time will tell.

        was awarded to scientists whose discoveries shed light on how the immune
        system can attack the body’s own cells while normally defending against
        infections. The prize was shared by Japan’s Shimon Sakaguchi and US
        researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell. They discovered the
        “security guards” of the immune system that eliminate immune cells that
        could otherwise attack the body.{" "}

          Their work is now being used to develop new treatments for autoimmune

        advancing every day.
