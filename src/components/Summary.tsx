        So where do we go from here? I am already due for my next lab work to
        let me know if my persistant sore throat is from a relapse or just
        another inconvenience of life. I am slowly realising a chronic illness
        is a marathon not a sprint. <br /> <br /> I have finished one year
        without meds and wondering at what point can I say this is behind me? I
        guess only time will tell.
